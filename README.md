## Description

These files contain a set of wooden-train-compatible track pieces in
the [sixty-degree system described by Dave
Barber](http://tamivox.org/dave/train/index60.html).  Unlike the
hodgepodge of pieces in the standard Brio/Thomas/Ikea/etc sets, track
assembled using these pieces will always go together and fit
perfectly.  No more frustration for you or your kids when your loops
don't *quite* close up.  No more [flexible
track](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:661462) kludges.

In addition, I've made adapter pieces for many popular accessories,
such as those from the
[Ertl Hometown Roadway](http://magicref.tripod.com/trains/trainhistory2.htm),
so that they fit into the 60-degree system.

#### Some discussion of size

Dave Barber suggests a base radius for the system of 200mm.  The core
hexagon will then have a diameter of 267mm and straights will be 231mm
long.

I have instead chosen a base radius of 154mm, which makes 7 hex cells
arranged flat-to-flat measure 49 inches.  That works well with a
[wTrak]-like system with 48" tables and 1" gaps between them (filled
with leg assemblies).  Our straights are about 7" long.

For comparison, according to
[woodenrailway.info](http://www.woodenrailway.info/track/trackguide.html)
the standard Brio "E" curve has a centerline radius of 202mm
and the tighter Brio "E1" curve has a centerline radius of 110mm.
Typical Brio straights are 4.5", 5.5", and 8.5".  Our 154mm curves
and 7" straights fit reasonably well into this family.

For riser heights, although the Brio standard is 64mm, some other sets
have 62mm risers.  We've split the difference in making levels separated
by 63mm.  This should be easily interoperable with existing pieces using
either the 62mm or 64mm heights.

We like the ["clickity-clack track that Learning Curve abandoned years ago"](http://wtrak.org/tracks.htm) so our rail pieces contain grooves for the ties
in order to make that audible clack as trains are rolled over it.
Most of our pieces have road on one side and rail on the other, so you
can play with cars or trains or both.
